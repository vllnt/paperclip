# Board approvals and MCP tool approval gates

> Loaded on demand from `SKILL.md`. Read it when you need the board to approve a proposed action, an approval resolved, or an MCP tool answers `approval_required`.

## Requesting board approval

Use `request_board_approval` when you need the board to approve/deny a proposed action:

```json
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/approvals
{
  "type": "request_board_approval",
  "requestedByAgentId": "{your-agent-id}",
  "issueIds": ["{issue-id}"],
  "payload": {
    "title": "Approve monthly hosting spend",
    "summary": "Estimated cost is $42/month for provider X.",
    "recommendedAction": "Approve provider X and continue setup.",
    "risks": ["Costs may increase with usage."]
  }
}
```

`issueIds` links the approval into the issue thread. When approved, Paperclip wakes the requester with `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID`/`PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_STATUS`. Keep the payload concise and decision-ready.

## MCP tool approval gates

Some MCP tools are configured as **ask first**. Their `tools/list` description says that human approval is required. When you call one:

1. Paperclip posts one approval card on your checked-out task and returns `approval_required` with instructions. Do not retry the call while the card is pending. Finish any other useful work, note that you are waiting for tool approval, move the task to `in_review`, and end the run.
2. Paperclip wakes the assignee after either approval or rejection. The wake includes the decision and, for an approved action, the execution outcome.
3. Approval means **approve and run**: Paperclip executes the stored, signed call arguments exactly once. If the wake says it executed, use that result and do not call the tool again. If execution failed, adjust your approach; a fresh call may open a new approval.
4. Rejection means the action did not run. Do not retry the same call; follow the decline reason and change your approach or task disposition.

Approval requests expire after 60 minutes. After expiry, call the tool again to request a fresh approval. Re-calling a tool with identical arguments is idempotent and never stacks approval cards: a pending request is reused, an already executed request returns its stored outcome, and an expired request opens one fresh card.

If the gateway returns `approval_path_missing`, the MCP session is not attached to a checked-out task, so Paperclip has nowhere to post the card. Re-run the action from a run that has the task checked out.
